[Version 7.5.2 release notes](https://github.com/archesproject/arches/blob/stable/7.5.2/releases/7.5.2.md)

#### Quick Install

Installation is fully documented in the official documentation, [arches.readthedocs.io/en/stable](https://arches.readthedocs.io/en/stable), but assuming you have all of the dependencies installed you should make a virtual environment, activate it, and then run
```
    pip install arches
```
then
```
    arches-project create myproject
```
enter the new `myproject` directory
```
    cd myproject
```
and run
```
    python manage.py setup_db
    python manage.py runserver
```
in a separate terminal, activate your virtual environment and navigate to the root directory of the project ( you should be on the same level as `package.json`) 
```
    cd myproject/myproject
```
and run
```   
    npm run build_development
```
to create a frontend asset bundle. This process should complete in less than 2 minutes.

Finally, visit `localhost:8000` in a browser (only Chrome is fully supported at this time).

If you run into problems, please review our full [installation documentation](http://arches.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installation/)

#### Release Cycle

Our general release cycle will typically be a functional release (either major if there are backward incompatible changes or minor, if there are not) every 6 months. Each functional release will typically be followed by one or more patch releases. See [semver.org](https://semver.org/) for version numbering.

-   Functional releases will usually introduce new functionality to the application, but could also include styling updates, enhancements to the UX, bug fixes, and performance improvements.
-   Patch releases are really only concerned with fixing any bugs related to the previous release or any other issues not yet addressed

#### Support for previous releases

- Stable releases will be supported with patch releases for at least 18 months. Typically the stable release will be the second or third minor release of a major release. 
- Functional releases (with the exception of stable releases) will be supported only until the next functional release. After that users are expected to upgrade to the latest release on [pypi.python.org](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/arches)

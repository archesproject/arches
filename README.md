#### Quick Install

Installation is fully documented in the official documentation, [arches.readthedocs.io/en/stable](https://arches.readthedocs.io/en/stable), but assuming you have all of the dependencies installed you should make a virtual environment, activate it, and then run

    pip install arches

then

    arches-project create myproject

enter the new `myproject` directory

    cd myproject

and run

    python manage.py setup_db
    python manage.py runserver

and visit `localhost:8000` in a browser (only Chrome is fully supported at this time).

If you run into problems, please review our the full [installation documentation](http://arches.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installation/)

#### Release Cycle

Our general release cycle will typically be a functional release (either major if there are backward incompatible changes or minor, if there are not) followed in 6-12 weeks by a bug release (patch). See [semver.org](https://semver.org/) for version numbering.

-   Functional releases will usually introduce new functionality to the application but could also include styling updates, enhancements to the UX, bug fixes, and general improvements.
-   Bug releases are really only concerned with fixing any bugs related to the previous release or any other issues not yet addressed

##### Support for previous releases

Functional releases will be supported until the next functional release. After that users are expected to upgrade to the latest release on [pypi.python.org](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/arches)

System Requirements
===================

Arches works on Linux, Windows, or macOS, but some of its dependencies may be more difficult to install on certain operating systems. Most enterprise-level installations of Arches have been created on Linux servers.

To begin development or make a test installation of Arches, you will need the following:

+ **2gb disk space**
	+ 1.5gb for all dependencies and 600mb for Arches.
	+ In production, the amount of disk space you need will depend on the number of resources in your database, specifically uploaded images or media files.

+ **4gb memory (RAM)**
	+ This recommendation is calculated by the fact that ElasticSearch requires 2gb to run, and as per `ElasticSearch documentation <https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/guide/current/heap-sizing.html#_give_less_than_half_your_memory_to_lucene>`_ no more than half of your system's memory should be dedicated to ElasticSearch.
	+ In development, it's possible to force ElasticSearch to run with only 1gb of memory, as we have noted `here <https://github.com/archesproject/arches/wiki/Installing-Elasticsearch#running-elasticsearch>`_.
	+ In production, you may want to increase your memory, and allow ElasticSearch to use more than its default.

*Please note that Arches 4.0.0 beta release is only fully supported in Chrome.*

Dependencies
============

* **PostgreSQL 9.6 with PostGIS 2.3** The easiest way to install this on OS X is `Postgres.app <http://postgresapp.com>`_. For Windows, use the `EnterpriseDB installers <https://www.postgresql.org/download/windows/>`_, and use Stack Builder (included) to get PostGIS.
* **GDAL** and **GEOS** GDAL Version > 1.11.5. On Windows, use the `OSgeo4W installer <https://trac.osgeo.org/osgeo4w/>`_, and choose to install the GDAL package.
* **Python 2.7.x** Installation instructions: https://www.python.org/downloads/. We recommend 2.7.13, and on Windows you must choose 32-bit or 64-bit Python depending on your operating system architecture.
* **pip** If you are using Python < 2.7.9, you will need to get pip from here: https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/installing.html. To be safe, you may as well upgrade pip right away with this command `python -m pip install. Once installed, run `python -m pip install --upgrade pip`. In Python 2.7.9 and later, pip is included by default.
* **Bower** Requires NodeJS/npm. Installation instructions here: https://bower.io/#install-bower 
* **Mapnik** Installation instructions: http://mapnik.org/pages/downloads.html. *Windows installation of Mapnik is currently under development.*
* **JDK** Use these installers: http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html. On Windows, be sure to set the JAVA_HOME system environment variable.
* **Elasticsearch** Please read `Installing Elasticsearch <https://github.com/archesproject/arches/wiki/Installing-Elasticsearch>`_ regarding Arches and Elasticsearch.

These instructions will provide some guidance on installing the required dependencies and getting Arches up and running quickly.

Installing Arches
===================

Once you have all of the dependencies installed, you can use ``pip`` to install Arches. It's best to do this in a virtual environment. Using a command prompt, follow these steps.

#. Create and enter a new directory called Projects

    ``mkdir Projects && cd Projects``
#. Create a virtual environment called ENV

    ``virtualenv ENV``
#. Activate the new virtual environment

    **Linux and macOS**
        ``source ENV/bin/activate``

    **Windows**
        ``ENV\Scripts\activate``

#. Install Arches into your virtual environment

    ``pip install arches==4.0b3``

    Arches is now installed! The next steps will guide you through the creation of an Arches "project".

#. Create a new Arches project

     A project is a standalone Arches app that sits outside of your virtual environment and facilitate all of the customizations that you will need to make one installation of Arches different from the next.

    **Linux and macOS**
        ``arches-project create my_project``

    **Windows**
        ``python C:\Projects\ENV\Scripts\arches-project create my_project``

#. Run the bower installation

    Enter your new project directory (``cd my_project``) and run

    ``bower install``

#. Setup your Arches database

    `You must have elasticsearch running for this step.`

    ``python manage.py packages -o setup_db``

#. Run the development server

    ``python manage.py runserver``

    You can now view Arches in a browser by navigating to ``localhost:8000``.

If you want to install Arches directly from the GitHub repo (instead of from the stable pip distribution), use `this documentation <https://github.com/archesproject/arches/wiki/Developer-Installation>`_.

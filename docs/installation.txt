System Requirements
===================

Arches works on Linux, Windows, or macOS, but some of its dependencies may be more difficult to install on certain operating systems. Most enterprise-level installations of Arches have been created on Linux servers.

To begin development or make a test installation of Arches, you will need the following:

+ **2gb disk space**
	+ 1.5gb for all dependencies and 600mb for Arches.
	+ In production, the amount of disk space you need will depend on the number of resources in your database, specifically uploaded images or media files.

+ **4gb memory (RAM)**
	+ This recommendation is calculated by the fact that ElasticSearch requires 2gb to run, and as per `ElasticSearch documentation <https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/guide/current/heap-sizing.html#_give_less_than_half_your_memory_to_lucene>`_ no more than half of your system's memory should be dedicated to ElasticSearch.
	+ In development, it's possible to force ElasticSearch to run with only 1gb of memory, as we have noted `here <https://github.com/archesproject/arches/wiki/Installing-and-Running-Elasticsearch#running-elasticsearch>`_.
	+ In production, you may want to increase your memory, and allow ElasticSearch to use more than its default.

*Please note that Arches 4.0.0 release is only fully supported in Chrome.*

Dependencies
============

* **PostgreSQL 9.6 with PostGIS 2.3** The easiest way to install this on OS X is `Postgres.app <http://postgresapp.com>`_. For Windows, use the `EnterpriseDB installers <https://www.postgresql.org/download/windows/>`_, and use Stack Builder (included) to get PostGIS.
* **GDAL** and **GEOS** GDAL Version > 1.11.5. On Windows, use the `OSgeo4W installer <https://trac.osgeo.org/osgeo4w/>`_, and choose to install the GDAL package.
* **Python 2.7.x** Installation instructions: https://www.python.org/downloads/. We recommend 2.7.12, and on Windows you must choose 32-bit or 64-bit Python depending on your operating system architecture.
* **pip** If you are using Python < 2.7.9, you will need to get pip from here: https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/installing.html. In Python 2.7.9 and later, pip is included by default. For good measure, you may as well upgrade pip right away with this command ``python -m pip install --upgrade pip``.
* **Bower** Requires NodeJS/npm. Installation instructions here: https://bower.io/#install-bower 
* **Mapnik** Version 2.2. Installation instructions: http://mapnik.org/pages/downloads.html. If you are on 64-bit Windows you will not be able to install Mapnik; the Python bindings are not compatible. Please read `this note on our Wiki <https://github.com/archesproject/arches/wiki/Installing-Dependencies-on-Windows#mapnik>`_ about how this limitation affects Arches.
* **JDK** Use these installers: http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html. On Windows, be sure to set the JAVA_HOME system environment variable.
* **Elasticsearch 5.2.1** Technically speaking, Elasticsearch is a dependency. However, Arches comes with an easy way to install it, which is described in `Installing and Running Elasticsearch <https://github.com/archesproject/arches/wiki/Installing-and-Running-Elasticsearch>`_. We recommend waiting until the end of step 5 below to deal with Elasticsearch.

These instructions will provide some guidance on installing the required dependencies and getting Arches up and running quickly.

* `Installing Dependencies Ubuntu <https://github.com/archesproject/arches/wiki/Installing-Dependencies-on-Ubuntu>`_
* `Installing Dependencies macOS <https://github.com/archesproject/arches/wiki/Installing-Dependencies-on-macOS>`_
* `Installing Dependencies Windows <https://github.com/archesproject/arches/wiki/Installing-Dependencies-on-Windows>`_

Installing Arches
===================

Once you have all of the dependencies installed, open a command prompt and use the following steps to install the latest stable release of Arches. To install the latest non-stable Arches code (generally only necessary for developers), you can follow `these installation steps <https://github.com/archesproject/arches/wiki/Developer-Installation>`_.

#. Create and enter a new directory called Projects::

    mkdir Projects && cd Projects

#. Create a virtual environment called ENV::

    virtualenv ENV

#. Activate the new virtual environment

    **Linux and macOS**::

        source ENV/bin/activate

    **Windows**::

        ENV\Scripts\activate

    .. note:: At this point (once the virtual environment is activated), Windows users need to manually install Shapely. `Follow these instructions <https://github.com/archesproject/arches/wiki/Installing-Dependencies-on-Windows#shapely>`_.

#. Install Arches into your virtual environment

    You can install Arches with pip::

        pip install arches --no-binary :all:

    .. warning:: Running a pip installation without the ``--no-binary :all:`` argument will install ``arches`` in your virtual environment, but will not install all of the separate python packages that you need. This will cause you to not be able to proceed with the following steps.

#. Create a new Arches project

    A project is a standalone Arches app that sits outside of your virtual environment and facilitates all of the customizations that you will need to make one installation of Arches different from the next.

    **Linux and macOS**::
    
        arches-project create my_project

    **Windows**::

        python C:\Projects\ENV\Scripts\arches-project create my_project

    .. note:: On Windows, the above command will end in an error on the last step of the command. The workaround for this is to enter ``my_project\my_project\`` (the directory that contains ``bower.json``) and run this command: ``bower install``.

    .. warning:: On Windows, you must specify the path to your GDAL library before continuing. Open ``settings.py`` in your new project and add this line: ``GDAL_LIBRARY_PATH = 'C:/OSGeo4W64/bin/gdal201.dll'`` Be sure to adjust the path as necessary for your installation, and note the *forward* slashes.

    At this point you should `install ElasticSearch <https://github.com/archesproject/arches/wiki/Installing-and-Running-Elasticsearch>`_ (unless you have done so already) before continuing.

#. Setup your Arches database

    First, make sure ElasticSearch is installed and running

    Then create your Arches database with::

        python manage.py packages -o setup_db

#. Run the development server

    To view Arches, run::

        python manage.py runserver

    You can now view Arches by navigating to ``localhost:8000`` in a browser.

More about Arches Projects
===========================

Arches Projects facilitate all of the customizations that you will need to make one installation of Arches different from the next. You can update html to modify web page branding, and add functions, datatypes, and widgets to introduce new functionality. A project sits outside of your virtual environment, and can thus be transferred to any other system where Arches is installed.

The general structure of a new Arches project is:::

	my_project/
	└─ manage.py
	└─ my_project/
	      └─ settings.py
	      └─ datatypes/
	      └─ functions/
	      └─ media/
	      └─ templates/
	      └─ widgets/

*Note that not all files are shown*

settings.py
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Many project-specific settings are defined here. You will likely want to add a ``settings_local.py`` file that can separately store variables that you may want to keep out of the public eye (db passwords, API keys, etc.).

templates
^^^^^^^^^^^

This directory holds HTML templates that you can modify to customize the branding and general appearance of your project.

datatypes, fuctions, and widgets
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

These directories will store the custom datatypes, functions, and widgets that you can create for the project. Developers interested in pursuing these customizations should start with `this customization documentation <https://github.com/archesproject/arches/wiki/Creating-New-Functions%2C-DataTypes%2C-and-Widgets>`_.

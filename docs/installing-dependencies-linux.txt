Installing Arches on Linux (Ubuntu 14.04)
===========================================

The following instructions were written with Ubuntu 14.04 LTS in mind.
Other versions of Ubuntu or other Linux distributions might have some
different steps, but the general outline should be similar. All
instructions assume that they are entered through the terminal and that
the user has root privileges. Installing on alternate flavors of Linux
will follow a similar pattern.

Of course, you may use the same instructions to install Arches either an
in-house or remote server. And, while this guide does not cover it,
Arches can be installed across multiple machines for deployments that
demand high fault tolerance.

Step 1: Install Required Dependencies
-------------------------------------

This step installs PostgreSQL, PostGIS, GEOS and the latest JDK by
running a single script.

.. note::

    If you would rather install the components seperately, simply open the
    script file and run only the portions of the script you want.

Download following shell script using wget:

::

    wget https://bitbucket.org/arches/arches3/raw/b295633aec4d5b3bb7cba10d439a43648ce75701/arches/install/ubuntu_trusty_setup.sh

Run the following script to build install PostgreSql, PostGIS, GEOS and
the latest JDK:

::

    ./ubuntu_trusty_setup.sh

.. warning::

    **PostgreSQL Warnings** 

    If you experience errors during the
    installation, please check that the setting
    'standard\_conforming\_strings' in 'postgresql.conf' is uncommented and
    set to 'off'.

.. warning::

    If you get an error similar to this, "Could not import user-defined
    GEOMETRY\_BACKEND "geos"", you might try adding the path to the GDAL dll
    to your archesproject/settings.py file (for more information see `the
    django docs <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.6/ref/contrib/gis/install/geolibs/#gdal-library-path>`__):

::

      GDAL_LIBRARY_PATH = '/path/to/libgdal.so'  #<-- make sure this path is correct and points to the actual .so file, note the forward slashess

.. note::

    We use the Django development server to make it easy for you to
    confirm that Arches has installed properly. You WILL NEED to configure
    Arches to use a production quality web server such as Apache if you want
    to use Arches in production. See the chapter on Arches configuration for
    guidance on how to complete this step.

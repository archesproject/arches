Installing Arches Dependencies on Windows
============================

This chapter presents the steps necessary to acquire and install the
Arches core software on your server.

Of course, you may use the same instructions to install Arches on either
an in-house or remote server. And, while this guide does not cover it,
Arches can be installed across multiple machines for deployments that
demand high fault tolerance.

  
Step 1: Install PostgreSQL 9.3, PostGIS 2.x
-------------------------------------------

Download and install PostgreSQL 9.3 for Windows from:

http://www.postgresql.org/download/.

**Notes:**

1.  Select all the default options when installing and take special note
    of the password you supply for the superuser (you’ll need this
    later, by default we assume the password ‘postgis’)
2.  At the end of the install leave the checkbox checked to run Stack
    Builder (which you’ll use to install PostGIS) then click the
    “Finish” button
3.  In the Stack Builder drop-down menu, select the local Postgres
    database (something like PostgreSQL 9.3 on port 5432) then click
    “Next”
4.  Expand the Spatial Extensions link and check the box for PostGIS.
    Click “Next”
5.  Select your download directory and click “Next” again
6.  Click “Next” to start the installation of PostGIS
7.  Select all the defaults until you get to the screen where it asks
    for your password. Type in the password that you created earlier.
8.  Select “Yes” to register the GDAL\_DATA environment variable ,unless
    you have it currently set to something else and you don’t want to
    override it.
9.  Click “Close” and then “Finish” to complete the setup of Postgres
    with PostGIS
10. Assuming that your Postgres installation is in C:Files.3, add this
    to your system PATH (If you are unsure how to do this, look `here`_
    ):

    ::

        C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\9.3\bin        

After installing PostgreSQL you’ll need to run 2 commands from a
command window (this only applies to PostgreSQL 9.2 and above).
Open a command window and at the command prompt type the following:

::

    createdb -U postgres -E UTF8 -T template0 template_postgis_20  
    psql -U postgres -d template_postgis_20 -c "CREATE EXTENSION postgis;"

.. note::

    To confirm that you have installed PostgreSQL, open a command window
    and type: psql. You should be prompted for a password. If so, then
    PostgreSQL is installed and you may close the command prompt. If you
    received an error like “psql is not recognized as an internal or
    external command, operable program or batch file” then you probably need
    to add an entry to your path.

.. warning::
        
    **PostgreSQL Warnings**

    If you experience errors during the
    installation, please check that the setting
    ‘standard\_conforming\_strings’ in ‘postgresql.conf’ is uncommented and
    set to ‘off’. See `this`_ question on stackoverflow for more
    information.

Step 2: Install GEOS
--------------------

Download and install GEOS from http://trac.osgeo.org/osgeo4w/

**Notes:**

-  Make sure to select the x86 version for 32bit machines, or x86-64 for
   64bit machines
-  Assuming that your OSGeo4W installation is in ``C:\OSGeo4W\``
   directory, add this to your system PATH:

    ::

        C:\OSGeo4W\bin

Step 3: Install Python 2.7.6
----------------------------

Download Python at http://www.python.org/download

**Notes:**

-  Download the latest MSI Installer for version 2.7.6 (Note: make sure
   to select the x86 version for 32bit machines, or x86-64 for 64bit
   machines)
-  Run the installer and select all the default options when prompted.
-  Assuming that your Python installation is in ``C:\Python27\``, add
   this to your PATH:

    ::

        C:\Python27\;C:\Python27\Scripts

.. warning::

    **Python Versions**

    While you should be able to install versions of Python later then **2.7.6**, we've had users say that they've had
    trouble with 2.7.7 and 2.7.8
    If you want a guaranteed good result stick with version **2.7.6**

Step 4: Install the latest Java Development Kit (JDK)
-----------------------------------------------------

Download and install the JDK from
http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html

**Notes:**

1.  Select all the default options, except at the very end, uncheck the
    box that asks to install the Ask.com toolbar.
2.  Right-click the “My Computer” icon on your desktop and select
    “Properties” to set the JAVA\_HOME environment variable.
3.  Click the “Advanced” tab.
4.  Click the “Environment Variables” button.
5.  Under “System Variables”, click “New”.
6.  Enter the variable name as JAVA\_HOME.
7.  Enter the variable value as the installation path for the Java
    Development Kit. (For example, if you used the default path for the
    Java Development Kit during installation, use
    ‘C:\Files\Java1.7.0_25’. This string should be your variable
    value.)
8.  Click “OK”.
9.  Click “Apply Changes”.
10. Close any command window which was open before you made these
    changes, and open a new command window. There is no way to reload
    environment variables from an active command prompt. If the changes
    do not take effect even after reopening the command window, restart
    Windows.

Initial Configuration
#####################

Quick Start
===========

Now that you have Arches installed, there are a few extra settings you must configure to make it fully operational. In the Arches interface, head to the **System Settings** menu.

The most important settings to begin with are related to the map on the Search page. 

1. Enter your Mapbox API Key.
    By default, Arches uses a few basemap services from Mapbox, for which you need to provide a key. You can get a free key at mapbox.com, and for installations that do not expect exceptionally heavy traffic, this free key will be sufficient. Once you have obtained the key, copy it from Mapbox (it will start with ``pk.``). Go to **System Settings -- > Map Settings --> Mapbox API** and enter key there.

    If you don't want to use MapBox, you can avoid this step by loading in a different basemap and removing all of the default MapBox layers. More about loading different basemaps in the `command line reference <https://github.com/archesproject/arches/wiki/Command-Line-Reference#importexport-commands>`_ documentation.

2. Set the default Map Zoom and Project Extent settings
    The Map Zoom is useful for geometry editing, but note that the Search page will automatically zoom to the extent of your search results every time they are updated. The Project Area is very important as it defines the area for your hexagon bins. It may be best to open a new tab with your Search page, make a change here in the Settings, and then refresh your Search page to preview the changes you make.
3. Change Hexagon Bin Settings
    Finally, you can change the size and precision of the search result hexagon bins. We recommend changing these settings in small increments, as making a *small* bin size with a *large* project area (for example) can be costly for your browser and may cause it to crash when loading the Search page.

After getting the Map Settings figured out, you will probably want to change the name of your app (System Settings), or create some Saved Searches to make it easier for the users to explore your database (Saved Searches).

All System Settings
============

System Settings
----------------

*Default Application Settings*

+ **Application Name** - Name of your Arches app, to be displayed in the browser title bar and elsewhere.
+ **Default Data Import/Export User** - Name to associate with data that is imported into the system.

*Web Analytics*

If you have made a Google Analytics Key to track your app's traffic, enter it here.

*Thesaurus Service Providers*

Advanced users may create more SPAQRL endpoints and register them here. These endpoints will be available in the RDM and allow you to import thesaurus entries from external sources.

Map Settings
-------------

*Mapbox API*

Arches uses the Mapbox mapping library for map display and data creation. Arches also supports Mapbox basemaps and other services.

+ **Mapbox API Key (Optional)** - By default, Arches uses some basemap web services from Mapbox. You will need to `create a free API key <"https://www.mapbox.com/help/create-api-access-token/">`_ (or "access token") for these services to be activated. Alternatively, you could remove all of the default basemaps and add your own, non-Mapbox layers.
+ **Mapbox Sprites** - Path to Mapbox sprites (use default).
+ **Mapbox Glyphs** - Path to Mapbox glyphs (use default).

*Project Extent*

Draw a polygon representing your project's extent. These bounds will serve as the default for the cache seed bounds, search result grid bounds, and map bounds in search, cards, and reports.

*Map Zoom*

You can define the zoom behavior of your maps by specifying max/min and default values. Zoom level 0 shows the whole world (and is the minimum zoom level). Most map services support a maximum of 20 or so zoom levels.

*Search Results Grid*

Arches aggregates search results and displays them as hexagons. You will need to set default parameters for the hexagon size and precision.

.. warning:: A large project area combined with a small hexagon size and/or high precision will take a very long time to load, and can crash your browser. We suggest changing these settings in small increments to find the best combination for your project.

Basic Search Settings
----------------------

Set the default search results behavior. This is also where you will define the max number of resources per export operation.

Temporal Search Settings
------------------------

Arches creates a Time Wheel based on the resources in your database, to allow for quick temporal visualization and queries. A few aspects of this temporal search are defined here.

+ **Color Ramp** - Currently unused (saved for future implementation). The color ramp for the time wheel. For further reference, check out the `d3 API reference <https://github.com/d3/d3-3.x-api-reference/blob/master/Ordinal-Scales.md>`_.
+ **Time wheel configuration** - Currently unused (saved for future implementation).

Saved Searches
----------------

Arches allows you save a search and present it as convenience for your users. Saved Searches appear as search options in the main Search page. Creating a Saved Search is a three-step process.

#. **Specify Search Criteria** - Go to the Search page and enter all the criteria you would like to use to configure your Saved Search. You may notice that with the addition of each new search filter (either by using the term filter, map filtering tools, or temporal filters) the URL for the page will change.
#. **Copy the URL** - In your browser address bar, copy the *entire* URL. This will be a long string that defines each of the search filters created in step 1.
#. **Create the Saved Search** - Finally, head back to this page and fill out the settings that you see at left. You can also upload an image that will be shown along with your Search Search.

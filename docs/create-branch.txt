Create a Branch
###############

Now that you've created a new Resource Model to record buildings, you need to add some Branches to it. A Branch is a configuration for a subset of information that you will store about the building.  We're going to make a branch to record the Name. This is done by completing the following tasks.

Configure the Branch Settings
=============================

Just as you created the Resource Model by defining a few settings, this will be your first step toward creating a Branch.

1. From the Arches Designer home page, choose |add-btn| > New Branch
2. You are now presented with the Settings menu for your new Branch. You will notice only small differences between these settings and those available for the Resource Model, but if you click |manage-btn|, you will see that a Branch has fewer designer tools than a Resource Model.
3. In the Identifiers tab, add "Name" as the Name, and choose "CIDOC CRM v6.2" for the ontology. Now, type "41" in the Root Class dropdown, and choose "E41_Appellation". 
4. In the Icon tab, type "tag" and choose the tag icon.
5. Again, you can skip the Appearance and Description tabs, unless you want to add extra information.
6. Finally, in the Status tab, set your Branch to Active.
7. Click |save-edits-btn|.

Create a Basic Branch Graph
===========================

Now that you've defined the Branch settings, you need to create its graph. A graph is a collection of nodes, where each node defines a piece of information that will be collected to describe your resource. In this Branch we will make a very simple graph, with a node to collect the name of the building. See About the Graph Designer for more information. 

1. From |manage-btn| choose Graph/Semantics to enter the Graph Manager.  
2. First, change the Node Name of your Top Node from "Top Node" to "Name".
3. Now, notice that the CRM Class is "E41_Appelation". This is because we defined that class as our Branch's root class in the settings.
4. Next, under Data Type, change the selection to "string", and click |save-edits-btn|
5. Now that our top node looks good, we can add a second node to the graph. Click |plus-btn| to begin this process.
6. You now see a list of the nodes you can add. Select the one called Node and click |add-node-confirm-btn|
7. In your new node, change the Node Name to "Name Type".
8. In CRM Class, type "55" to find "E55 Type".
9. In Relationship to Name choose "P2_has_type".
10. Under Data Type, select "concept".
11. In Concept Collection, choose "Name Type".
12. Click |save-edits-btn|.

You have now completed your first graph, and it should look like this:

Configure the Branch's Card
===========================

By creating the graph, you defined what information will be contained in this Branch. In our example so far, the branch will store a Name value, linked to a Name Type value. However, you still need to define how the user will enter that information. This is done through Widgets, which are likewise stored in Cards.  

1. From |manage-btn| choose Cards.
2. Once in the Card Manager, you are presented with a default configuration, based on the contents of the graph. Because we have a very simple graph, the card is very simple also.
3. Change the Card Tab Title to "Identification", and add instructions if desired.
4. You may find that the Name Type dropdown widget is positioned above the Name text input widget. You can change the order of these widgets by dragging Name Type below Name in either the Card contents pane on the left, or in the Card mockup itself on the right.
5. Click |done-btn|.

You have now finished creating a new Branch, albeit, a very simple one. First, you updated the settings--name, ontology, etc.--of the Branch. Then, you created the graph that models what information will be collected through this Branch, and, finally, you configured the Card that will be used to collect this information. Now, we have to add this Branch to the Resource Model we created earlier. Return to the Arches Designer main page and head to :doc:`add-branch-to-resource-model`.

Creating Resources

Resource Manager
````````````````````````````

You may create new Resources only if you have access to the Resource Manager page. From there, you will begin by choosing which Resource Model you would like to use. Note that a Resource Model must have its status set to **active** and must have **at least one menu** added it in order for it to be used.

*Your Resource Manager page may look different, depending on what Resource Models you have set up in your database.*

Resource Editor
````````````````````````````

The Resource Editor is used to create new or edit existing Resources. On the left-hand side of the page you are presented with the list of Menus associated with this Resource Model, each holding one or more data-entry cards. Cards may be further divided, with tabs appearing across the top.

The procedure for entering data depends on the widget: sometimes you'll enter text, sometimes select from a dropdown menu, or sometimes record a location by drawing geometry on a map. One thing to keep in mind generally is that certain attributes are allowed to have multiple values recorded, while some will only allow one value.

As an example, Name/Name Type pairs tend to allow multiple values. Above, two new Name/Name Type pairs are added. Note the manner in which saved values are summarized above the data entry widget. You may directly edit these existing values where they appear in this summary.

Related Resources
````````````````````````````

In the Resource Editor you can also access the Related Resources page. Creating a resource relation is a three-step process.

#. Find a Resource

    Using one (or more) of the available search methods, find the resource to which you would like to create a relation. As you apply more filters, the search results will be updated.

#. Create the Relation

    Once the resource you would like to relate to appears in the search results, click "Relate Resource" to create the relation. You will see the new relation visualized on the right. You can view existing relations as a grid (table) or as a graph (connected nodes).

    *If you see "Cannot Be Related" next to a Resource in the search results, this means that relationships have not been enabled between these two Resource Models. A user with access to the Arches Designer can change this by editing the settings for either Resource Model.*

#. Edit Relation Properties

    After a relation has been created, you can further refine its properties, such as what type of relation it is, how long it lasted, etc. While viewing the relation in grid mode, begin by selecting the relation in the table. You will see the "Delete Selected" button appear. Next click "relation properties", enter the information, and don't forget to "Save" when finished.

Arches HIP Contents
############################

By default, Arches ships with a set of cohesive Resource Models, Branches, and Concepts which form the v4 version of Arches-HIP (Heritage Inventory Package), a data schema that was originally developed for `Historic Places L.A. <http://historicplacesla.org>`_. HPLA is the Arches implementation in Los Angeles that was designed to hold data from the ongoing Survey LA project.

To import this entire data schema into your Arches database, use these commands (with your virtual environment activated)::

    python manage.py packages -o import_graphs
    python manage.py packages -o python manage.py packages -o import_reference_data -s arches/db/schemes/arches_concept_scheme.rdf -ow overwrite -st keep
    python manage.py packages -o python manage.py packages -o import_reference_data -s arches/db/schemes/arches_concept_collections.rdf -ow overwrite -st keep

The package comprises 6 Resource Models and 36 Branches.

Resource Models
===============
+ Activity Resource Model
    This resource model describes activities relating to heritage resources and heritage resource groups.
+ Actor Resource Model
    This resource model describes actor resources such as individual people and groups of people. 
+ Heritage Resource Group Resource Model
    This resource model describes heritage resource groups which are groupings of historically significant resources.  Those historically significant resource may more may not themselves be instances of Heritage Resource.
+ Heritage Resource Model
    This resource model describes heritage resources, which includes monuments, buildings, structures, etc.
+ Historical Event Resource Model
    Resource Model for the Historical Event Resource (E5), which is used to describe significant historical events.
+ Information Resource Model
    This resource model defines information resources, such as images, reports, and publications. 

Branches
===============
+ Activity Phase
    Describes the time span and type of an Activity Resource.
+ Actor Phase
    Phase Type Assignment for the Actor resource model.
    
    Connects to Actor E39 via P41i
+ Appellation
    Describes an appellation assigned to an Actor Resource.
    
    Relates to resource model via P131
+ Beginning of Existence
    Describes the type and time span of the beginning of a resource's existence.
    
    Relates to the Actor resource model E39 via P92i.
    Relates to Historic Event E5 and Activity E7 via p116i.
+ Component
    Physical thing on a heritage resource. Connect to Heritage Resource E18 via P46
+ Condition Assessment
    Describes the conditions, threats, and disturbances affecting a Heritage Resource or Heritage Resource Group. Additional information may include a management recommendation, a condition image, the data the condition was assessed and a description of the condition.
+ Description
    Generic branch for capturing free-form written descriptive information.
    Intended to be evolution from v3 description branch from HIP 3. Created semantic description node with description string and description type hanging off of it. Description (semantic node) becomes a grouping node (type and string).  
    
    This branch meets technical business rules for CRM compliance but CRM experts have said that this is an inappropriate implementation of E62.
    
    Connects to all resources with P140i
+ End of Existence
    Describes the type and time span of the end of a resource's existence.
    
    Relates to the Actor E39 Resource Model via P93i
+ Evaluation
    This branch evaluates instances of Heritage Resource E18 and Heritage Resource Group E27, and is based on the City of Los Angeles' SurveyLA survey methodology for evaluation of  significance and eligibility for designation as a heritage resource or heritage resource group. Evaluation consists of defining a historic context (Evaluation Criteria) which triggers specific eligibility requirements (Eligibility Requirements) and results in the selection of one or more status codes (Status) and the writing of a reasons statement (Reasons). The branch also contains nodes to record the date of Evaluation, the dates defining the Period of Significance for evaluation.
    
    Relates to E18 and E27 resource models via P140i.
+ Event Phase Type
    Describes a Historical Event Type within a given timespan/phase. 
    
    Connects to the Historical Event resource model via P10
+ Existence
    Start/End dates for resources.  Assumed to be typed and within calendar time.

+ External Identifier
    Used to hold identifiers necessary to link a given resource to records in an external (perhaps legacy) system.
+ Heritage Resource Group Phase Type

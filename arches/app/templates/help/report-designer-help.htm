        <p>The Report Designer allows you to fine-tune many aspects of this Report. By default it is populated with all of the Cards in your Resource Model, each of which becomes a section in the Report. To exclude a section from publication, you can select it in the contents panel at left and toggle the <em>Publish Section</em> control. You can also change the order of the sections by dragging them in the contents panel, and relabel any section or its internal parts.</p>
        <h4>Configuring Headers</h4>
        <p>To set a Report as the active one for your Resource Model, you'll need to select the Header section in the contents panel, and use the "Active" switch. Only one Report may be active at a time, so any other Reports associated with this Resource Model will be set to "inactive". Other Header settings are described below.</p>

        <p><strong>Report Title</strong>: add a title which will appear at the top of the report</p>

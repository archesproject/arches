        <p>The Report Designer allows you to fine-tune many aspects of this Report. By default it is populated with all of the Menus in your Resource Model, each of which becomes a section in the Report. To exclude a section from publication, you can select it in the contents panel at left and toggle the <em>Publish Section</em> control. You can also change the order of the sections by dragging them in the contents panel, and relabel any section or its internal parts.</p>

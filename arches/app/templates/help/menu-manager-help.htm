    <p>Data entry users will create Resources in your database by using a series of Menus. Each Menu is a series of Cards. By grouping Cards into Menus, you are able to present an editor with a thematically organized data entry experience.</p>
    <p>To add a new Menu to your Resource Model, click Add Menu, and you will be brought to the Menu Designer. To edit an existing Menu, select it in the "Edit an existing Menu..." dropdown, or click on its representative button at left. You will then be brought to the Menu Designer.</p>

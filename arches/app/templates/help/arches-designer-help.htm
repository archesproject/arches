        <p>{% blocktrans %}The Arches Designer provides a comprehensive set of tools for designing the structure of your database, the details of your data entry forms, and how data are presented in reports. To begin this process, you'll need to become familiar two very important concepts: {% endblocktrans %}</p>
        <p>{% blocktrans %}<strong>Resource Models</strong> - Resource Models are top-level categories for Resources in your database. When creating new Resources, a data entry user must decide which Resource Model to use, thereby defining what information is collected for the Resource. <em>The entire Arches Designer exists to facilitate the creation and customization of Resource Models. {% endblocktrans %}</em></p>
        <p>{% blocktrans %}<strong>Branches</strong> - Branches are building blocks that aid in the creation of Resource Models. When you add a Branch to a Resource Model, its contents are copied into the Resource Model. This allows you to further customize the Resource Model while leaving the original Branch unaltered. {% endblocktrans %}</p>
        <p>{% blocktrans %}Now that you have an idea of what Branches and Resource Models are, you're ready to learn more about the components they are made of. {% endblocktrans %}

The smallest component of a Graph is a Node, which either defines a data attribute or serves as an intermediary between other Nodes. A second level of organization is created by Nodegroups, each of which is a collection of one or more Nodes." %}</p>

In some cases a complex Branch may have multiple Cards aggregated into a Card Container. However, Card Containers function just like Cards do, so it may be easiest to think of each Branch as having one Card, while each Resource Model will have as many Cards as Branches that have been added to it." %}</p>

                <strong>Contents</strong> This section gives an overall list of the items you have at your disposal while using the tool. In the Graph Designer, for example, you'll see a list of Nodes, and in the Report Designer a list of Cards.<br>
                <strong>Manager</strong> Generally, this central panel is where the action takes place. You'll configure settings, modify labels, and define permissions here, depending on
                which tool you are using.<br>
                <strong>Preview</strong> In many tools, a preview is provided on the right. Where the contents panel will list the items at your disposal, the preview panel will display them as they may show up elsewhere in the app.

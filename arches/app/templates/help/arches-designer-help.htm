        <p>The Arches Designer provides a comprehensive set of tools for designing the structure of your database. To begin this process, you'll need to become familiar with the terminology and  components that you'll be using.</p>

                <a href="javascript:void(0)" class="ep-help-topic-toggle"><h5>Resource Models</h5></a>
                <div class="ep-help-topic-content">
                    <p>Resource Models are top-level categories for Resources in your database. When creating new Resources, a data entry user must decide which Resource Model to use. The entire Arches Designer exists to facilitate the creation and customization of Resource Models.</p>

                <a href="javascript:void(0)" class="ep-help-topic-toggle"><h5>Branches</h5></a>
                <div class="ep-help-topic-content">
                    <p>Branches are reusable data structures that aid in the creation of Resource Models. When you add a Branch to a Resource Model, its contents (i.e. its Graph and Card) is copied over. This allows you to further customize the Resource Model while leaving the original Branch unaltered.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div>
                <a href="javascript:void(0)" class="ep-help-topic-toggle"><h5>Graph</h5></a>
                <div class="ep-help-topic-content">
                    <p>A Graph is the logical framework that defines the set of attributes for either a Branch or a Resource Model. Graphs comprise nodegroups--collections of one or more nodes that either represent data to be collected, or serve as connections to other nodes. When adding a Branch to a Resource Model, that Branch's Graph is copied into the Resource Model's Graph. Thus, you should think of a Resource Model's Graph as a compilation of all the Branches that have been added to it.</p>

                <div class="ep-help-topic-content">
                    <p>A Card is the data entry representation of a Branch's Graph; it is where you define how information will be collected for each node. Therefore, each Branch has one Card, while each Resource Model will have as many Cards as Branches that have been added to it.</p>

                <div class="ep-help-topic-content">
                    <p>Only Resource Models have Menus, which are groupings of Cards to allow for an organized, thematic approach to data entry.</p>

                <div class="ep-help-topic-content">
                    <p>Only Resource Models have Reports, which allow you to control how a Resource's attributes will be presented to the public.</p>

                <div class="ep-help-topic-content">
                    <p>Only Resource Models have Functions. Functions are behind the scenes operations that are run whenever a user creates or edits a Resource.</p>

                <div class="ep-help-topic-content">
                    <p>As described above, a Branch consists of a Graph (made of node and nodegroups) and a Card. In the diagram below, you can see how these components are connected.</p>

                <div class="ep-help-topic-content">
                    <p>Now consider what happens when a Branch is added to a Resource Model. Its component parts are copied into the Resource Model, and in the Resource Model you will add the Cards to Menus to organize the data entry process.</p>
                    <p><img src="/media/img/help/resource-model-diagram-1.png"></img></p>
                    <p>Note that you can further edit a Resource Model's Graph and Cards after the Branch has been added, and these changes will be reflected in the Menus.</p>

        <div class="ep-help-topic-content">
            <p>In many of the Arches Designer tools, the interface is split into three sections, as shown in the image below.</p>
            <p><img src="/media/img/help/card-designer-panes.png"></img></p>
            <p>
                <strong>Contents</strong> This section gives an overall list of the items you have at your disposal while using the tool. In the Graph Designer, for example, you'll see a list of Nodes, and in the Report Designer a list of Cards.<br>
                <strong>Manager</strong> Generally, this central panel is where the action takes place. You'll configure settings, modify labels, and define permissions here, depending on
                which tool you are using.<br>
                <strong>Preview</strong> In many tools, a preview is provided on the right. Where the contents panel will list the items at your disposal, the preview panel will display them as they may show up elsewhere in the app.

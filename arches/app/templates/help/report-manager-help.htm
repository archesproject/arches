        <p>When a user wants to learn more about a resource in your database, they will be brought to the Resource Report, an aggregation of all the information that defines the Resource. This Report Manager exists to ease the process of creating Reports for new Resource Models.</p>
        <p> To begin, choose a template from the left panel. If you plan to show a Resource's location, for example, choose the Map Header Template. You will notice that by default, a new Report is set as <em>Inactive</em>. This allows the Report to remain hidden from users until you have finished configuring it. To configure a Report, click on it and you'll be brought to the Report Designer.</p>

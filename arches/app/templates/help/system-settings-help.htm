        <div class="ep-help-topic-content">
            <h4>Mapbox API</h4>
            <p>Arches uses the Mapbox mapping library for map display and data creation. Arches also supports Mapbox basemaps and other services.</p>
            <p>
                <strong>Mapbox API Key (Optional)</strong> - By default, Arches uses some basemap web services from Mapbox. You will need to <a href="https://www.mapbox.com/help/create-api-access-token/">create a free API key</a> (or "access token") for these services to be activated. Alternatively, you could remove all of the default basemaps and add your own, non-Mapbox layers.<br>
                <strong>Mapbox Sprites</strong> - Path to Mapbox sprites (use default).<br>
                <strong>Mapbox Glyphs</strong> - Path to Mapbox glyphs (use default).<br>
            </p>
            <h4>Project Extent</h4>
            <p>Draw a polygon representing your project's extent. These bounds will serve as the default for the cache seed bounds, search result grid bounds, and map bounds in search, cards, and reports.</p>
            <h4>Map Zoom</h4>
            <p>You can define the zoom behavior of your maps by specifying max/min and default values. Zoom level 0 shows the whole world (and is the minimum zoom level). Most map services support a maximum of 20 or so zoom levels.</p>
            <h4>Search Results Grid</h4>
            <p>Arches aggregates search results and displays them as hexagons. You will need to set default parameters for the hexagon size and precision.</p>
            <p><em><strong>Warning:</strong> A large project area combined with a small hexagon size and/or high precision will take a very long time to load, and can crash your browser. We suggest changing these settings in small increments to find the best combination for your project.</em></p>

        <a href="javascript:void(0)" class="ep-help-topic-toggle"><h4>Temporal Search Settings</h4></a>
        <div class="ep-help-topic-content">
            <p>Arches creates a Time Wheel based on the resources in your database, to allow for quick temporal visualization and queries. A few aspects of this temporal search are defined here.</p>
            <p>
                <strong>Color Ramp</strong> - The color ramp for the time wheel. For further reference, check out the <a href="https://github.com/d3/d3-3.x-api-reference/blob/master/Ordinal-Scales.md">d3 API reference</a>.<br>
                <strong>Time wheel configuration</strong> - Configure the time wheel here (____).

        <a href="javascript:void(0)" class="ep-help-topic-toggle"><h4>Saved Searches</h4></a>
        <div class="ep-help-topic-content">
            <p>Arches allows you save a search and present it as convenience for your users. Saved Searches appear as search options in the main Search page. Creating a Saved Search is a three-step process.</p>
            <p>
                <strong>1. Specify Search Criteria</strong> - Go to the Search page and enter all the criteria you would like to use to configure your Saved Search. You may notice that with the addition of each new search filter (either by using the term filter, map filtering tools, or temporal filters) the URL for the page will change.<br>
                <strong>2. Copy the URL</strong> - In your browser address bar, copy the <em>entire</em> URL. This will be a long string that defines each of the search filters created in step 1.<br>
                <strong>3. Create the Saved Search</strong> - Finally, head back to this page and fill out the settings that you see at left. You can also upload an image that will be shown along with your Search Search.

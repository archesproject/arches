        <p>The Menu Designer helps you configure the data entry Menus for your Resource Model. You will need to define some settings for the Menu, and then add some Cards to it. When you have saved your edits, click "Back to Menus" to return to the Menu Manager, or find a new Menu to edit in the dropdown.</p>

            <p>To add a Card to this Menu, you must first find it in the Data Card Library. This is a listing of all the Cards associated with your Resource Model, so if you don't see a Card that you are wanting to use, you'll need to head to the Graph Manager or Card Manager to add that Card's Branch. When you've found the Card you want, just drag it into the center panel.</p>
            <p>In the example below, two Cards--Description and Appellation--are added to a Menu named "Summary".</p>

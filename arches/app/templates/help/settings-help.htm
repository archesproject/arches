        <p>These settings will create important metadata for this {% if graph.isresource %}Resource Model{% else %}Branch{% endif %}. With a few exceptions, these are the same settings you will be able to define for a {% if graph.isresource %}Branch{% else %}Resource Model{% endif %} as well.</p>

            <p>
                <strong>Name</strong> - Used to identify this {%if graph.isresource%}Resource Model{%else%}Branch{%endif%} throughout the app interface. Default is {%if graph.isresource%}"New Resource Model"{%else%}"New Branch"{%endif%}.<br>
                <strong>Subtitle</strong> - optional subtitle, displayed on the Arches Designer home page<br>
                <strong>Ontology</strong> - Decide whether an ontology will be enforced in this {%if graph.isresource%}Resource Model's{%else%}Branch's{%endif%} graph. To learn more about what this means, read <a href="https://arches4.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ontologies-in-arches">Ontologies in Arches</a>. By default, you are allowed to choose between using the CIDOC CRM v6.2, or using no ontology. <em>Note that once a node has been added to this {%if graph.isresource%}Resource Model's{%else%}Branch's{%endif%} graph the <em>Ontology</em> setting becomes fixed.</em><br>
                <strong>Root Class</strong> - This setting is only necessary if an <em>Ontology</em> has been chosen. Define the ontology class of the root node for this {%if graph.isresource%}Resource Model's{%else%}Branch's{%endif%} graph.

            <p>Both Resource Models and Branches should be identified by an icon, which is used throughout the app interface. You can browse the icons to select one, or type in the search bar to filter them.</p>
            <p><em>Arches uses the <a href="http://fontawesome.io/">Font Awesome</a> icon library; custom icons are not supported.</em></p>

            <p>You can optionally add an <strong>Author</strong> and <strong>Abstract</strong> to this {%if graph.isresource%}Resource Model{%else%}Branch{%endif%}. These settings are especially helpful if multiple resource designers are working on the same Arches installation.</p>

                <strong>Active</strong> - You will not be able to create Resources using this Resource Model until you have set its status to <em>Active</em>. Use <em>Inactive</em> while designing a Resource Model over an extended period of time.</br>

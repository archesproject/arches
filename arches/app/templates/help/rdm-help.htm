        <p>{% blocktrans %}The Reference Data Management (RDM) enables the creation and maintenance of controlled vocabularies that are used throughout your database. In Arches, controlled vocabularies consist of Concepts, and these Concepts are managed in Thesauri and Collections. In the RDM you can create new Thesauri, create new Concepts, import Concepts from external an endpoint (like the Getty AAT), and -- the ultimate goal -- create Collections, which will be used in your database as data input dropdown lists.{% endblocktrans %}</p>

                <p>{% blocktrans %}A Concept is a qualitative property that can be attached to a resource, something like "Stone" (which may describe a building material) or "House" (which may describe a past use for a structure). The advantage of storing these properties as Concepts is that a Concept may have attributes of its own. In the case of "House", we could add an alternate label, "Dwelling" to that Concept. Then, if a user searches for "dwelling", any resource with the "House" Concept attached to it will be found.{% endblocktrans %}</p>
                <p>{% blocktrans %}Concepts can also be nested, to allow more complex and meaningful relationships between them. For example, "House" may appear next to "School" within a parent Concept called "Building Use".{% endblocktrans %}</p>

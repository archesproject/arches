            <p>Widgets are data entry helpers for each node that collects information; it's often easier to pick a date from a calendar than to type it in, for example. Generally, the datatype of the node will determine which Widget template is used. However, in the case of a concept that will be picked from a list, you can choose a dropdown menu or a set of radio buttons, and for free text you can choose a basic text box or a rich text editor.</p>
            <p>In the Widget Manager, you can further refine how a user will interact with a Widget. Note that in every case you can enter a custom label, but other settings depend on the Widget template. Many of these settings are optional, and all come with acceptable defaults.</p>

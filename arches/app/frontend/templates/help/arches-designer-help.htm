            <p>{% blocktrans %}At the core of an Arches database are a series of structures called "graphs", of which there are two types:{% endblocktrans %}</p>
            <p>{% blocktrans %}<strong>Resource Models</strong> -  When creating new Resources, a data entry user must decide which Resource Model to use, determining what information is collected for the Resource. Think of different Resource Models as categories of records in your database&mdash;"Buildings" vs. "Archaeological Sites" vs. "Cemeteries", for example. Every Arches database must have at least one Resource Model.{% endblocktrans %}</em></p>
            <p>{% blocktrans %}<strong>Branches</strong> - You can think of Branches as "partial" graphs that can be aggregated to form the "full" graph of a Resource Model. They function as resuable building blocks, allowing you to avoid having to manually recreate complex structures in multiple Resource Models.{% endblocktrans %}</p>

"            <p>Widgets are data entry helpers for each node that collects "
"information; it's often easier to pick a date from a calendar than to type "
"it in, for example. Generally, the datatype of the node will determine which "
"Widget template is used. However, in the case of a concept that will be "
"picked from a list, you can choose a dropdown menu or a set of radio "
"buttons, and for free text you can choose a basic text box or a rich text "
"editor.</p>\n"
"            <p>In the Widget Manager, you can further refine how a user will "
"interact with a Widget. Note that in every case you can enter a custom "
"label, but other settings depend on the Widget template. Many of these "

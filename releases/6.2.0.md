### Upgrading Arches
1. You must be upgraded to at least version 6.0 before proceeding.

2. Be sure to backup your database before proceeding

3. Remove django-revproxy `pip uninstall django-revproxy` 

4. Upgrade to Arches 6.2.0

        pip install --upgrade arches

5. Within your project with your Python 3 virtual environment activated:

        python manage.py migrate

6. **Important:** If you are maintaining an Arches package, be sure to export your graphs and resource instance data before re-importing or reloading your package. 

### Upgrading an Arches project

    
1. Update your JavaScript dependencies

    Your project's package.json file looks something like this (Yours maybe different, but only `arches` and packages supporting project customizations will be listed in the dependencies):

    ```    
    {
        "name": "myproject",
        "dependencies": {
            "arches": "archesproject/arches#stable/6.1.0",
        }
    }
    ```
    Change the arches version number to `#stable/6.2.0`

    **If your package.json does not have arches listed as a dependency**, follow the instructions of [step 1 here](https://github.com/archesproject/arches/blob/master/releases/5.1.0.md#upgrading-an-arches-project) to update your package.json file. Be sure to use #stable/6.2.0 as the version number for arches when you update your package.json file.
    
    Once your package.json file is updated, navigate to the directory where `package.json` is located and run: ```yarn install```

2. Ensure any references to `staticfiles` inside your project templates are changed to `static`
    - eg. `{% load staticfiles %}` -> `{% load static %}`

3. Ensure the item in `LANGUAGES` that matches `LANGUAGE_CODE` is enabled in your project's `settings.py` 
    ```
    LANGUAGE_CODE = "en"

    LANGUAGES = [
    #   ('de', _('German')),
        ('en', _('English')),
    #   ('en-gb', _('British English')),
    #   ('es', _('Spanish')),
    ]
    ```

4. If you are running Celery with `supervisord`, you may need to update your `celeryd.conf` file. The location of this file is dependent on your system:
```
# 6.1.0

command=/path/to/virtualenv/bin/celery worker -A [app].celery --loglevel=INFO
```
```
# 6.2.0

command=/path/to/virtualenv/bin/celery -A [app].celery worker  --loglevel=INFO
```

5. If you are running Arches on Apache, be sure to run:

    ```
    python manage.py collectstatic
    ```
    and restart your server.
    ```
    sudo service apache2 reload
    ```

6. Finally, If you are running Celery, you should also restart your Celery worker(s). The process for doing this depends on how Celery is being run.

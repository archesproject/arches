### Upgrading Arches

1. Upgrade to version 7.6.0 before proceeding by following the upgrade process in the [Version 7.6.0 release notes](https://github.com/archesproject/arches/blob/dev/7.6.x/releases/7.6.0.md)

2. Upgrade to Arches 7.6.1
    ```
    pip install --upgrade arches==7.6.1
    ```

3. Update the JavaScript dependencies and devDependencies:
    In the project's `package.json` file change arches from `stable/7.6.0` to `stable/7.6.1`:
    ```    
        "dependencies": {
            "arches": "archesproject/arches#stable/7.6.1",
        },
        "devDependencies": {
            "arches-dev-dependencies": "archesproject/arches-dev-dependencies#stable/7.6.1"
        }
    ```
    In in your terminal navigate to the directory with your project's package.json file. Then run:

        yarn install


4. Start your application server in a separate terminal if it's not already running. Your webpack build will not complete without your application server running.

5. In a different terminal navigate to the directory with your project's package.json file, run `npm start` or `npm run build_development`. This will generate your `media/build` directory.
   - If running your project in development:
     -  `npm start` will build the frontend of the application and then start a webpack development server
      - `npm run build_development` will build a development bundle for the frontend assests of the application -- this should complete in less than 2 minutes
    - If running your project in production:
      - `npm run build_production` This builds a production bundle. **takes up to 2hrs depending on resources**
      - Alternatively you can `cd ..` up a directory and run `python manage.py build_production`. This will create a production bundle of frontend assessts and also call `collectstatic`.


6. If you are running Arches on Apache, be sure to run:

    ```
    collectstatic
    ```
    and restart your server:
    ```
    sudo service apache2 reload
    ```

Arches 7.6.0 Release Notes
--------------------------

### Major enhancements

- An interface for developing front-end features in Vue is now provided via the ``createVueApplication()`` function. A minimal example is available in the [Arches Vue Integration Styleguide](https://github.com/archesproject/arches-docs/blob/master/docs/developing/vue/arches-vue-integration.md). The ``createVueApplication()`` function is experimental in 7.6. It currently registers all available ``PrimeVue`` services and directives, such as [toast (error messaging) plugins](https://primevue.org/toast/), [tooltip animations](https://primevue.org/tooltip/), and more. Over time, if some of these features do not see significant use in core Arches (or if registering them leads to a performance drag), they may be dropped from the ``createVueApplication()`` wrapper. Implementers may always register any needed plugins/services in their own Vue applications. (Note: The vast majority of ``PrimeVue``'s functionality does not require these services or directives.)

- Adds Vue internationalization (i18n)

- Adds TypeScript support

- Adds frontend testing and Python testing for projects

- Adds Github actions to build applications, run tests, and compare coverage between branches for projects.

- Plugins now support the configuration boolean `is_standalone`. Standalone plugins do not appear in the sidebar, and do not display the sidebar or application header.

### Performance Improvements
- 10453 Reduce queries for related objects when indexing resources

- 10490 Fixes an issue where webpack receives multiple build calls when running in a container
- 10710 Workflow history API: return 400 (instead of 401) for attempts to update completed workflows
- 9768 Filter out tiles created during resource creation from activity stream API
- 9769 Ensure resource creation edit log timestamps precede resource update timestamps
- 10738 Adds Github action for comparing test coverage between branches and rejecting branches that lower test coverage
- 10842 Adds project-level testing and GitHub test runners
- 10699 Allow overriding search_results view
- 10911 Styling fix in resource model manage menu
- 10726 Upgrade openpyxl package to 3.1.2 and fixes ETL modules
- 9191 Adds unlocalized string datatype
- 10781 Graph.delete_instances() now uses BulkDataDeletion

### Breaking changes

- The minimum supported version of Python is now 3.10. Python 3.11 is encouraged, as it is significantly faster.
- The minimum supported version of Node.js is now 20.12.2. 
- ESLint has been updated to 9.0.0, and requires configuration via `eslint.config.mjs` rather than `.eslintrc`

Minor incompatibilities:

-  The signature of `Graph.delete_instances` changed from:
    ```
        def delete_instances(self, verbose=False):
    ```
    to:
    ```
        def delete_instances(self, userid=None, verbose=False):
    ```


### Upgrading Arches

1. You must be upgraded to at least version 7.5.0 before proceeding. If you are on an earlier version, please refer to the upgrade process in the [Version 7.5.0 release notes](https://github.com/archesproject/arches/blob/dev/7.5.x/releases/7.5.0.md)

2. Be sure to backup your database before proceeding.

3. Upgrade to Arches 7.6.0
    ```
    pip install --upgrade arches==7.6.0
    ```

4. Uninstall removed dependencies:
    ```
    pip uninstall django_compressor
    pip uninstall django-libsass
    pip uninstall mapbox-vector-tile
    ```

### Upgrading an Arches project

1. If you have made customizations to files in your webpack directory, backup that directory as those files will be overwritten in the following steps. Read [this](https://github.com/archesproject/arches/blob/dev/7.6.x/arches/webpack/README.md) for more information.

2. Add GNU gettext to your system:
    1.  If using Ubuntu/Linux:
        ```
        sudo apt-get update
        sudo apt-get install gettext
        ```

    2.  If using macOS:
        ```
        brew install gettext
        brew link --force gettext
        ```

    3.  If using Windows:

        You can run the scripts and install gettext under WSL2 like you would with regular Ubuntu (recommended) or install gettext via mingw64 or cygwin. 
        You may also find precompiled binaries [here](https://mlocati.github.io/articles/gettext-iconv-windows.html)

3. Update Node.js to v20.12.2 -- the latest LTS version. 
    - See: https://nodejs.org/ (choose the installer appropriate to your operating system)

4. Move `package.json` up a directory level, it should be in the same directory as `manage.py`.

5. Update `package.json`:
    1. Add a license field
    ```
    {
        ...
        "license": "AGPL-3.0-only",
        "scripts": {
            ...
    ```
    2. Update the value of `scripts`:
    ```
        ...
        "scripts": {
            "build_development": "yarn eslint:check && yarn ts:check && cross-env NODE_OPTIONS=--max-old-space-size=2048 webpack --config ./webpack/webpack.config.dev.js",
            "build_production": "yarn eslint:check && yarn ts:check && cross-env NODE_OPTIONS=--max-old-space-size=2048 NODE_ENV=production webpack --config ./webpack/webpack.config.prod.js",
            "build_test": "yarn eslint:check && yarn ts:check && cross-env NODE_OPTIONS=--max-old-space-size=2048 webpack --config ./webpack/webpack.config.dev.js --env test=true",
            "eslint:check": "eslint **/src",
            "eslint:fix": "eslint **/src --fix",
            "eslint:watch": "nodemon --watch . --ext ts,vue --exec yarn --silent eslint:check",
            "gettext:extract": "vue-gettext-extract",
            "gettext:compile": "vue-gettext-compile",
            "ts:check": "vue-tsc --noEmit",
            "ts:watch": "vue-tsc --watch --noEmit",
            "start": "cross-env NODE_OPTIONS=--max-old-space-size=2048 webpack serve --config ./webpack/webpack.config.dev.js",
            "vitest": "vitest --run --coverage"
        },
        ...
    }
    ```
    4. Update the dependency references to `stable/7.6.0`:
    ```    
    {
        "dependencies": {
            "arches": "archesproject/arches#stable/7.6.0",
        },
        "devDependencies": {
            "arches-dev-dependencies": "archesproject/arches-dev-dependencies#stable/7.6.0"
        }
    }
    ```

6. If your project has any CSS files with import statements, update the pattern. For example:
    ```
    @import '../node_modules/my-frontend-dependency/style.min.css';
    ```
    would be changed to:
    ```
    @import url(node_modules/my-frontend-dependency/style.min.css);
    ```

7. Update `.gitignore`:
    1. Change `${project_name}/media/node_modules` to `node_modules`
    2. Change `${project_name}/webpack/webpack-stats.json` to `webpack/webpack-stats.json`
    3. If it exists, remove `${project_name}/webpack/webpack-user-config.js`

8. In settings.py:
    1. Remove `"compressor"` from `INSTALLED_APPS`
    2. Update `WEBPACK_LOADER` to the following:
        ```
        WEBPACK_LOADER = {
            "DEFAULT": {
                "STATS_FILE": os.path.join(APP_ROOT, '..', 'webpack/webpack-stats.json'),
            },
        }
        ```
9. In urls.py:
   1.  Update SHOW_LANGUAGE_SWITCH to the following:

        *Note: If the previous code was uncommented in your project make sure to uncomment the new code.*
        ```
        # if settings.SHOW_LANGUAGE_SWITCH is True:
        #     urlpatterns = i18n_patterns(*urlpatterns)
        #     urlpatterns.append(path("i18n/", include("django.conf.urls.i18n")))
        ```

10. Run `python manage.py updateproject`

11. Navigate to the directory with your project's package.json file. Then run:
    ```
    yarn install
    ```

12. Start your application server in a separate terminal if it's not already running.

13.  In the same terminal window where you ran `yarn` ( on the same level as `package.json` ):

    1.  Run `yarn gettext:extract` followed by `yarn gettext:compile`. This will generate i18n files in your `locale` directory. Even if you're
        not planning on internationalizing your project, it's important to have these files for creating Vue components.

    2.  Run `yarn start` or `yarn build_development`. This will generate your `media/build` directory.
        - If running your project in development:
        -  `yarn start` will build the frontend of the application and then start a webpack development server
        - `yarn build_development` will build a development bundle for the frontend assests of the application -- this should complete in less than 2 minutes
        - If running your project in production:
        - `yarn build_production` This builds a production bundle. **takes up to 2hrs depending on resources**
        - Alternatively you can run `python manage.py build_production`. This will create a production bundle of frontend assessts and also call `collectstatic`.

14.  If you are running Arches on Apache, be sure to run:

    ```
    collectstatic
    ```
    and restart your server
    ```
    sudo service apache2 reload
    ```

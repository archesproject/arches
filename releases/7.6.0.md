Arches 7.6.0 Release Notes
--------------------------

### Major enhancements

- An interface for developing front-end features in Vue is now provided via the ``createVueApplication()`` function. A minimal example is available in the [Arches Vue Integration Styleguide](https://github.com/archesproject/arches-docs/blob/master/docs/developing/vue/arches-vue-integration.md). The ``createVueApplication()`` function is experimental in 7.6. It currently registers all available ``PrimeVue`` services and directives, such as [toast (error messaging) plugins](https://primevue.org/toast/), [tooltip animations](https://primevue.org/tooltip/), and more. Over time, if some of these features do not see significant use in core Arches (or if registering them leads to a performance drag), they may be dropped from the ``createVueApplication()`` wrapper. Implementers may always register any needed plugins/services in their own Vue applications. (Note: The vast majority of ``PrimeVue``'s functionality does not require these services or directives.)

- `yarn` has been deprecated and replaced with `npm`

- Adds Vue internationalization (i18n)

- Adds TypeScript support

- Adds frontend testing and Python testing for projects

- Adds Github actions to build applications, run tests, and compare coverage between branches for projects.

- 10804 Search has been re-architected to be totally component-based, now governed by `search-view` components. See [docs](https://arches.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developing/reference/search-components/) for more details.

- Term Search: When selecting a Term Match from the term search dropdown, the ensuing query will match on both the Term Value *and* the Nodegroup corresponding to the one in the context label. String search still works as expected, annotated explicitly with the translation "Contains Term: "
- 10862 JSON-LD bulk import module

- Adds Bulk Concept Editor to bulk data manager, #11117

- Adds subdomain routing, which allows projects to handle different subdomains separately within the same application (eg. `api.my_arches_project.com`, `admin.my_arches_project.com`, and `www.my_arches_project.com`) 

- Adds `base-root.htm` template, which can be inherited by plugin templates for display without the Arches header and side navigation.

- Adds permission frameworks - including "standard" (current behavior and default) and "default deny" (future (8.x) default - all users are denied resource permissions until they are explicitly granted). This also gives developers the ability to implement their own custom permission framework.

### Breaking changes

- The minimum supported version of Python is now 3.10. Python 3.11 is encouraged, as it is significantly faster.
- The minimum supported version of Node.js is now 20.14.0. 
- ESLint has been updated to 9.0.0, and requires configuration via `eslint.config.mjs` rather than `.eslintrc`
- As part of the changes to allow for new permissions frameworks, the method signature for get_nodegroups_by_perm has changed - instead of returning a set of NodeGroups, it now returns a list of UUIDs.

Minor incompatibilities:

-  The signature of `Graph.delete_instances` changed from:
    ```
        def delete_instances(self, verbose=False):
    ```
    to:
    ```
        def delete_instances(self, userid=None, verbose=False):
    ```
-   The signature of `arches.app.utils.module_importer.get_class_from_modulename` changed from:
    ```
        def get_class_from_modulename(modulename, classname, directory_list)
    ```
    to:
    ```
        def get_class_from_modulename(modulename, classname, extension_type: ExtensionType)
    ```
-   `BaseImportModule.cumulative_excel_files_size` became
    `BaseImportModule.cumulative_files_size` (and a similar change was made to the JSON
    return value of `BaseImportModule.read`.)
-   `BaseImportModule.stage_files` is now abstract. (It used to call
    `stage_excel_files()`, which was only defined on certain subclasses.) `stage_files()`
    is now a more attractive target for overriding than `run_load_task()`.
-   `GeojsonFeatureCollectionDataType` moved from `arches.app.datatypes.datatypes` to `arches.app.datatypes.core`.
-   `unzip_file()` moved from `arches.setup` to `arches.app.utils.zip`
-   Version-related utils moved from `arches.setup` to `arches.version`
-   `add_to_update_fields()` moved from `arches.app.models.models` to `arches.app.models.utils`.
-   `arches.app.utils.compatibility` was removed in favor of a Django system check.

### Deprecations

- Boolean values for the `FILE_TYPE_CHECKING` setting are deprecated. Starting with Arches 8.0, the allowed values will be:
    - `None`
    - `"lenient"` (new in 7.6)
    - `"strict"`

    For more, see the [documentation](https://arches.readthedocs.io/en/stable/configuring/settings-beyond-the-ui/#file-type-checking) for this setting. 

- As a consequence of migrating from `setup.py` to `pyproject.toml`, the `-o install` argument to `manage.py packages` (previously used to execute a project's `setup.py`) does nothing and has been deprecated. In Arches 8.0, it will raise an exception.

### Upgrading Arches

1. You must be upgraded to at least version 7.5.0 before proceeding. If you are on an earlier version, please refer to the upgrade process in the [Version 7.5.0 release notes](https://github.com/archesproject/arches/blob/dev/7.5.x/releases/7.5.0.md)

2. Be sure to backup your database before proceeding.

3. Upgrade to Arches 7.6.0
    ```
    pip install --upgrade arches==7.6.0
    ```

4. Uninstall removed Python dependencies:
    ```
    pip uninstall django_compressor
    pip uninstall django-libsass
    pip uninstall mapbox-vector-tile
    ```

5. Uninstall removed system dependencies:
    - `yarn`
        - This will differ depending on how `yarn` was installed.
            - brew: `brew uninstall yarn`
            - tarball: `rm -rf "$HOME/.yarn"`
            - npm: `npm uninstall -g yarn`
            - ubuntu: `sudo apt-get remove yarn && sudo apt-get purge yarn`
            - centos: `yum remove yarn`
            - windows: `choco uninstall yarn`

### Upgrading an Arches project


1. Follow instructions to upgrade each Arches project database to Postgres 14 or higher. https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/upgrading.html

2. If you have made customizations to files in your webpack directory, backup that directory as those files will be overwritten in the following steps. Read [this](https://github.com/archesproject/arches/blob/dev/7.6.x/arches/webpack/README.md) for more information.

3. Add GNU gettext to your system:
    1.  If using Ubuntu/Linux:
        ```
        sudo apt-get update
        sudo apt-get install gettext
        ```

    2.  If using macOS:
        ```
        brew install gettext
        brew link --force gettext
        ```

    3.  If using Windows:

        You can run the scripts and install gettext under WSL2 like you would with regular Ubuntu (recommended) or install gettext via mingw64 or cygwin. 
        You may also find precompiled binaries [here](https://mlocati.github.io/articles/gettext-iconv-windows.html)

4. Update Node.js to v20.14.0 -- the latest LTS version. 
    - See: https://nodejs.org/ (choose the installer appropriate to your operating system)

5. Move `package.json` up a directory level, it should be in the same directory as `manage.py`.

6. Update `package.json`:
    1. Add a license field
    ```
    {
        ...
        "license": "AGPL-3.0-only",
        "scripts": {
            ...
    ```
    2. Update the value of `scripts`:
    ```
        ...
        "scripts": {
            "build_development": "npm run eslint:check && npm run ts:check && cross-env NODE_OPTIONS=--max-old-space-size=2048 webpack --config ./webpack/webpack.config.dev.js",
            "build_production": "npm run eslint:check && npm run ts:check && cross-env NODE_OPTIONS=--max-old-space-size=2048 NODE_ENV=production webpack --config ./webpack/webpack.config.prod.js",
            "build_test": "npm run eslint:check && npm run ts:check && cross-env NODE_OPTIONS=--max-old-space-size=2048 webpack --config ./webpack/webpack.config.dev.js --env test=true",
            "eslint:check": "eslint **/src",
            "eslint:fix": "eslint **/src --fix",
            "eslint:watch": "nodemon --watch . --ext ts,vue --exec npm run --silent eslint:check",
            "gettext:extract": "vue-gettext-extract",
            "gettext:compile": "vue-gettext-compile",
            "prettier:check": "prettier {{ project_name }}/src --check",
            "prettier:fix": "prettier {{ project_name }}/src --write",
            "ts:check": "vue-tsc --noEmit",
            "ts:watch": "vue-tsc --watch --noEmit",
            "start": "cross-env NODE_OPTIONS=--max-old-space-size=2048 webpack serve --config ./webpack/webpack.config.dev.js",
            "vitest": "vitest --run --coverage"
        },
        ...
    }
    ```
    3. Add and populate an `overrides` section:
    ```
    "overrides": {
        "moment-timezone": "^0.5.45",
        "nomnom": "npm:@gerhobbelt/nomnom",
        "rimraf": "^5.0.7",
        "underscore": "^1.13.6"
    }
    ```
    4. Update the dependency references to `stable/7.6.0`:
    ```    
    {
        "dependencies": {
            "arches": "archesproject/arches#stable/7.6.0",
        },
        "devDependencies": {
            "arches-dev-dependencies": "archesproject/arches-dev-dependencies#stable/7.6.0"
        }
    }
    ```
    5. If you are using any relative dependency pathing ( eg. file:./path/to/local/dependency ) it must be removed because of the hoisting differences between yarn and npm. It should instead point towards a repository or npm package.

7. Any `yarn` references will need to be updated to use `npm` instead. For instance, if you have any scripts calling `yarn install` or `yarn build_development`, they will need to be updated to `npm install` and `npm run build_development`.

8. If your project has any CSS files with import statements, update the pattern. For example:
    ```
    @import '../node_modules/my-frontend-dependency/style.min.css';
    ```
    would be changed to:
    ```
    @import url(node_modules/my-frontend-dependency/style.min.css);
    ```

9. Update `.gitignore`:
    1. Change `${project_name}/media/node_modules` to `node_modules`
    2. Change `${project_name}/webpack/webpack-stats.json` to `webpack/webpack-stats.json`
    3. If it exists, remove `${project_name}/webpack/webpack-user-config.js`

10. In settings.py:
    1. In `INSTALLED_APPS`:
        - remove `"compressor"`
        - add `"django_hosts"`
        - ensure your project is listed first (or at least before any other Arches Applications)

    2. After `INSTALLED_APPS`, add this line to ensure "arches.app" (provider of core arches templates) always follows any Arches Applications:
        ```
        INSTALLED_APPS += ("arches.app",)
        ```

    3. Add the following lines, replacing `{{ project_name }}` with the name of your project:
        ```
        ROOT_HOSTCONF = "{{ project_name }}.hosts"
        DEFAULT_HOST = "{{ project_name }}"
        ```

    4. In `MIDDLEWARE`, uncomment `django.middleware.clickjacking.XFrameOptionsMiddleware`. (If you serve Arches content in a frame, configure the `X_FRAME_OPTIONS` [setting](https://docs.djangoproject.com/4.2/ref/clickjacking/#how-to-use-it).)

    5. Add the following lines *after* `MIDDLEWARE`:
        ```
        MIDDLEWARE.insert(  # this must resolve to first MIDDLEWARE entry
            0, 
            "django_hosts.middleware.HostsRequestMiddleware"
        )

        MIDDLEWARE.append(  # this must resolve last MIDDLEWARE entry
            "django_hosts.middleware.HostsResponseMiddleware"
        )  
        ```

    6. Update `WEBPACK_LOADER` to the following:
        ```
        WEBPACK_LOADER = {
            "DEFAULT": {
                "STATS_FILE": os.path.join(APP_ROOT, '..', 'webpack/webpack-stats.json'),
            },
        }
        ```

    7. Update `LOCALE_PATHS.append(...)` to `LOCALE_PATHS.insert(0, ...)`
        ```
        LOCALE_PATHS.insert(0, os.path.join(APP_ROOT, 'locale'))
        ```
        
    8. Add `"json"` to `FILE_TYPES` if you wish to use the JSON-LD bulk import module.
        
    9. Remove the `ARCHES_APPLICATIONS` setting.

    10. Remove `MIN_ARCHES_VERSION` and `MAX_ARCHES_VERSION`. (If you had values other than `None` here, make a note of these values for use when `pyproject.toml` is discussed below.)

    11. Replace:
        ```
        STATICFILES_DIRS = build_staticfiles_dirs(
            root_dir=ROOT_DIR,
            app_root=APP_ROOT,
            arches_applications=ARCHES_APPLICATIONS,
        )
        ```
        with:
        ```
        STATICFILES_DIRS = build_staticfiles_dirs(app_root=APP_ROOT)
        ```
    12. Replace:
        ```
        TEMPLATES = build_templates_config(
            root_dir=ROOT_DIR,
            debug=DEBUG,
            app_root=APP_ROOT,
            arches_applications=ARCHES_APPLICATIONS,
        )
        ```
        with:
        ```
        TEMPLATES = build_templates_config(
            debug=DEBUG,
            app_root=APP_ROOT,
        )
        ```
    13. Remove the following block:
        ```
        if __name__ == "__main__":
            transmit_webpack_django_config(
                root_dir=ROOT_DIR,
                app_root=APP_ROOT,
                arches_applications=ARCHES_APPLICATIONS,
                public_server_address=PUBLIC_SERVER_ADDRESS,
                static_url=STATIC_URL,
                webpack_development_server_port=WEBPACK_DEVELOPMENT_SERVER_PORT,
            )
        ```

12. Update urls.py:
    ```
    from django.conf import settings
    from django.conf.urls.static import static
    from django.conf.urls.i18n import i18n_patterns
    from django.urls import include, path

    urlpatterns = [
        # project-level urls
    ]

    # Ensure Arches core urls are superseded by project-level urls
    urlpatterns.append(path('', include('arches.urls')))

    # Adds URL pattern to serve media files during development
    urlpatterns += static(settings.MEDIA_URL, document_root=settings.MEDIA_ROOT)

    # Only handle i18n routing in active project. This will still handle the routes provided by Arches core and Arches applications,
    # but handling i18n routes in multiple places causes application errors.
    if settings.ROOT_URLCONF == __name__:
        if settings.SHOW_LANGUAGE_SWITCH is True:
            urlpatterns = i18n_patterns(*urlpatterns)

        urlpatterns.append(path("i18n/", include("django.conf.urls.i18n")))
    ```

13. If you have updated `templates/javascript.htm` in your project with any project-level urls, they must be moved to `templates/arches_urls.htm`. All other updates to `templates/javascript.htm` should remain in-place. eg:
    ```
    <!-- my_project/templates/javascript.htm -->

    {% extends "javascript.htm" %}

    {% load static %}
    {% load l10n %}
    {% load i18n %}


    {% block arches_urls %}
    {{ block.super }}
    <div class="arches-urls"
        my_project_url = "{% url 'my-project-url' %}"
    ></div>
    {% endblock arches_urls %}

    {% block arches_translations %}
    {{ block.super }}
    <div class='arches-translations'
        my-project-translation-string='{% trans "My Project Translation String" as myProjectTranslationString %}  "{{ myProjectTranslationString|escapejs }}"'
    ></div>
    {% endblock arches_translations %}
    ```

    Should now be:

    ```
    <!-- my_project/templates/arches_urls.htm -->

    {% extends "arches_urls.htm" %}

    {% load static %}
    {% load l10n %}
    {% load i18n %}

    {% block arches_urls %}
    {{ block.super }}
    <div class="arches-urls"
        my_project_url = "{% url 'my-project-url' %}"
    ></div>
    {% endblock arches_urls %}
    ```

    With any `arches_urls` block taken out of `javascript.htm`:
    ```
    <!-- my_project/templates/javascript.htm -->

    {% extends "javascript.htm" %}

    {% load static %}
    {% load l10n %}
    {% load i18n %}

    {% block arches_translations %}
    {{ block.super }}
    <div class='arches-translations'
        my-project-translation-string='{% trans "My Project Translation String" as myProjectTranslationString %}  "{{ myProjectTranslationString|escapejs }}"'
    ></div>
    {% endblock arches_translations %}
    ```

14. Within your project, with your Python 3 virtual environment activated:
    ```
    python manage.py updateproject
    ```

    - Pay attention to notices about existing conflicting files that need manual reconciliation with the [updated project template](https://github.com/archesproject/arches/blob/stable/7.6.0/arches/install/arches-templates), if any. Some templates may have placeholders with `{{ project_name }}` or `{{ project_name_title_case }}` that need to be replaced with your actual project name.

15. At the project root, you now have a `pyproject.toml` file containing your project's metadata. If you had any runtime dependencies other than `arches` in `my_project/install/requirements.txt` (or any development dependencies in `my_project/install/requirements_dev.txt`), move them to the corresponding dependency blocks in `pyproject.toml`.  The core arches (runtime) dependency is already specified for you, as well as some development dependencies needed for the new GitHub Actions templates in this version.

    - If you had values other than ``None`` in ``MIN_ARCHES_VERSION`` and ``MAX_ARCHES_VERSION`` in settings.py, update the core arches dependency in the `dependencies` block of `pyproject.toml`.

16. Run `python manage.py migrate`.

17. If you do any custom development, update and reinstall the python development dependencies, and install the pre-commit hooks. (You can always ignore these hooks with `git commit --no-verify`.)

    1. Navigate to the directory with your project's .pre-commit-config.yaml file.
        ```
        pip install -e '.[dev]'
        pre-commit install
        ```

18. Navigate to the directory with your project's package.json file. Then run:
    ```
    npm install
    ```

19. Start your application server in a separate terminal if it's not already running.

20.  In the same terminal window where you ran `npm` ( on the same level as `package.json` ):

    1.  Run `npm run gettext:extract` followed by `npm run gettext:compile`. This will generate i18n files in your `locale` directory. Even if you're
        not planning on internationalizing your project, it's important to have these files for creating Vue components.

    2.  Run `npm start` or `npm run build_development`. This will generate your `media/build` directory.
        - If running your project in development:
        -  `npm start` will build the frontend of the application and then start a webpack development server
        - `npm run build_development` will build a development bundle for the frontend assests of the application -- this should complete in less than 2 minutes
        - If running your project in production:
        - `npm run build_production` This builds a production bundle. **takes up to 2hrs depending on resources**
        - Alternatively you can run `python manage.py build_production`. This will create a production bundle of frontend assessts and also call `collectstatic`.

20. Test your project with deprecation warnings enabled.

    ```
    python -Wall::DeprecationWarning manage.py test --settings=tests.test_settings
    ```

21. Run system checks against your production settings.

    ```
    python manage.py check --deploy --settings=path.to.production.settings
    ```

22. Be sure that your web server has write access to the following files:

    ```
    ${project_name}/.frontend-configuration-settings.json
    ${project_name}/.tsconfig-paths.json
    ```

23. If you are running Arches on Apache, be sure to run:

    ```
    collectstatic
    ```
    and restart your server
    ```
    sudo service apache2 reload
    ```

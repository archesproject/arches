### Arches 5.0 release notes

The Arches team has been busy improving Arches and fixing several bugs as well.
Below you'll find a listing of more changes included in the latest release.

Some of the highlights:

- Upgraded Arches to use Python 3.7 and Django 2.2
- Upgraded Arches to use a later version (7.4) of Elasticsearch
- Upgraded Arches to use Postgres 12 and PostGIS 3

#### Upgrading Arches

Users are encouraged to update at their earliest convenience.  Completely re-installing Arches is the easiest way to accomplish this.

If you can't completely re-install Arches (because you have data in the system that you want to preserve) then you'll need to upgrade by running the following commands in your activated virtual environment:

    pip install arches --upgrade --no-binary :all:
    
#### Update Arches to use the latest Elasticsearch
[this should be updated]

    python manage.py es install

This will put the latest version of Elasticsearch into the directory from which you ran the previous command.  At this point you can move the elasticsearch-6.6.2 directory to a new location if you desire.

Now do the following:

- Stop the currently running Elasticsearch instance.
- Copy the `data` directory from your old Elasticsearch instance to the new instance
- Start the new instance of Elasticsearch

Now you can run the following commands

    python manage.py migrate

After you are satisifed that Elasticsearch has been upgraded properly you may remove the old elasticsearch-5.2.1 directory and remove the following indexes which have been superceeded:
    
- {my_proj_name}_strings
- {my_proj_name}_resource
- {my_proj_name}_resource_relations_temp


If you have Arches running on a web server such as Apache, be sure to update your static files directory and restart your web server.

As always the documentation can be found at <http://arches.readthedocs.io>

#### Upgrading an Arches project
[this should be updated]

1.  Update the knockout.js package from 3.4 to 3.5 in your project by editing the line in your package.json:

        "knockout": "3.5.0",

        and run: `yarn install`


#### Additional steps for developers:

<!-- If you are running arches from a git repo, be aware that you will need to update your Python dependencies by running (with your virtualenv activated):


    pip install -r arches/install/requirements.txt
    pip install -r arches/install/requirements_dev.txt

 -->

Arches 8.0.0 Release Notes
--------------------------

### Major enhancements

- Controlled List Manager and Reference datatype:

    This version of Arches decouples the configuration of controlled vocabulary usage in a
    project (for instance, to drive a dropdown) from the management of those controlled
    vocabularies themselves (for instance, by a vocabulary authority). The new reference
    datatype links to a specific controlled list, which can be configured in the new
    Controlled List Manager.

    For more, see (link to forthcoming blog post or documentation? Or arches-lingo?)

### Breaking changes
- The `TileModel` entity has been updated. Instead of `nodegroup` acting as a foreign key to the `Nodegroup` table, it has been replaced with `nodegroup_id`, a simple UUID field. There is now a `nodegroup` class method that will retrieve the Nodegroup from the `nodegroup_id` field, but any direct database references to `nodegroup` should be updated.

### Upgrading Arches

1. You must be upgraded to at least version   before proceeding. If you are on an earlier version, please refer to the upgrade process in the []()

### Upgrading an Arches project

2. In `settings.py`:

### Breaking changes
- The `TileModel` entity has been updated. Instead of `nodegroup` acting as a foreign key to the `Nodegroup` table, it has been replaced with `nodegroup_id`, a simple UUID field. There is now a `nodegroup` class method that will retrieve the Nodegroup from the `nodegroup_id` field, but any direct database references to `nodegroup` should be updated.

### Upgrading Arches

1. You must be upgraded to at least version   before proceeding. If you are on an earlier version, please refer to the upgrade process in the []()

### Upgrading an Arches project

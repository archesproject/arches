### Breaking changes
- The `TileModel` entity has been updated. Instead of `nodegroup` acting as a foreign key to the `Nodegroup` table, it has been replaced with `nodegroup_id`, a simple UUID field. There is now a `nodegroup` class method that will retrieve the Nodegroup from the `nodegroup_id` field, but any direct database references to `nodegroup` should be updated.

- Following a deprecation in 7.6.0, the `-o install` argument to `manage.py packages` has been removed.

### Breaking changes
- The minimum supported version of Python is now 3.11.

- The minimum supported version of GDAL is now 2.4 (along with GEOS 3.8).

- The `TileModel` entity has been updated. Instead of `nodegroup` acting as a foreign key to the `Nodegroup` table, it has been replaced with `nodegroup_id`, a simple UUID field. There is now a `nodegroup` class method that will retrieve the Nodegroup from the `nodegroup_id` field, but any direct database references to `nodegroup` should be updated.

- Following a deprecation in 7.6.0, the `-o install` argument to `manage.py packages` has been removed.

- `ensure_userprofile_exists()` was removed from the `Tile` model.

- The `arches` object is no longer available in frontend components that exist outside of defined Arches patterns. If your project contains Vue components that are mounted on templates that inherit directly from `base-root.htm`, they will need to be updated to use `generateArchesURL` and the settings API instead.

### Upgrading Arches

1. You must be upgraded to at least version   before proceeding. If you are on an earlier version, please refer to the upgrade process in the []()

### Upgrading an Arches project

1. Upgrade the `requires-python` value in pyproject.toml to `">=3.11"`.

1. Remove "3.10" from the `python-version` matrix in `.github/workflows/main.yml`.

1. In settings.py, add the following key to `DATABASES` to [improve indexing performance](https://github.com/archesproject/arches/issues/11382):
    ```
    "OPTIONS": {
        "options": "-c cursor_tuple_fraction=1",
    },
    ```

1. Update your frontend dependencies:
    ```
    rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
    npm install
    ```

1. Update `.gitignore`:
    1. Remove `.tsconfig-paths.json` and `.frontend-configuration-settings.json`
    2. Add `frontend_configuration`

1. Replace the `generate_frontend_configuration` import statement in `apps.py`:
    ```
    from arches.settings_utils import generate_frontend_configuration
    ```

    Should be updated to:

    ```
    from arches.app.utils.frontend_configuration_utils import generate_frontend_configuration
    ```

1. Within your project, with your Python 3 virtual environment activated:
    ```
    python manage.py migrate
    ```

1. Create editable_future_graphs for your Resource Models using the command `python manage.py graph create_editable_future_graphs`. This will publish new versions of each Graph.

1. Update your Graph publications and Resource instances to point to the newly published Graphs by running `python manage.py graph publish --update -ui`

1. Within your project with your Python 3 virtual environment activated:
    ```
    python manage.py es reindex_database
    ```

1. Run `npm start` or `npm run build_development` to rebuild your static asset bundle:
    - If running your project in development:
    -  `npm start` will build the frontend of the application and then start a webpack development server
    - `npm run build_development` will build a development bundle for the frontend assests of the application -- this should complete in less than 2 minutes
    - If running your project in production:
    - `npm run build_production` This builds a production bundle. **takes up to 2hrs depending on resources**
    - Alternatively you can run `python manage.py build_production`. This will create a production bundle of frontend assessts and also call `collectstatic`.

### Upgrading Arches

1. Upgrade to version 7.3.0 before proceeding. If upgrading from an earlier version, refer to the upgrade process in the [Version 7.3.0 release notes](https://github.com/archesproject/arches/blob/dev/7.3.x/releases/7.3.0.md)

2. Be sure to backup your database before proceeding.

3. Upgrade to Arches 7.4.0
    ```
    pip uninstall psycopg2-binary
    pip install --upgrade arches==7.4.0
    ```

4. Within your project, with your Python 3 virtual environment activated:
    ```
    python manage.py migrate
    ```

5. Reindex your database:
   ```
   python manage.py es reindex_database
   ```

6. Update the JavaScript dependencies and devDependencies:
    In the project's `package.json` file change arches from `stable/7.3.0` to `stable/7.4.0`:
    ```    
        "dependencies": {
            "arches": "archesproject/arches#stable/7.4.0",
        },
        "devDependencies": {
            "arches-dev-dependencies": "archesproject/arches-dev-dependencies#stable/7.4.0"
        }
    ```

7. Start your application server in a separate terminal if it's not already running. Your webpack build will not complete without your application server running.

8. In the same terminal window where you ran `yarn` ( on the same level as `package.json` ), run `yarn start` or `yarn build_development`. This will generate your `media/build` directory.
   - If running your project in development:
     -  `yarn start` will build the frontend of the application and then start a webpack development server
      - `yarn build_development` will build a development bundle for the frontend assests of the application -- this should complete in less than 2 minutes
    - If running your project in production:
      - `yarn build_production` This builds a production bundle. **takes up to 2hrs depending on resources**
      - Alternatively you can `cd ..` up a directory and run `python manage.py build_production`. This will create a production bundle of frontend assessts and also call `collectstatic`.
  

6. If you are running Arches on Apache, be sure to run:

    ```
    collectstatic
    ```
    and restart your server.
    ```
    sudo service apache2 reload
    ```
